## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

1. Identify and create variables & constants
1. Identify and define types in Swift
1. Formulate and use functions to encapsulate code with parameters and return values
1. Identify and write comments in code

## Swift Intro

Swift is a programming language to write software for phones, wearables, desktops, servers, and much more. It was releases in June 2014 by Apple. The language is a combination of years of Apple engineering development and the contribution of an open-source community.

Swift is beginner friendly, it's a language that's easy to start writing code with. Thanks to Swift playgrounds it's easy and fast to experiment without having to set up an app in Xcode. Xcode is the environment where we build apps.

Swift is safe, fast, interactive and optimized for performance and development.
