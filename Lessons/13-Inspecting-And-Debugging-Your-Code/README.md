Concepts:
  - Debug bar
  - Variables view
  - Console
  - Set breakpoints
  - Print objects with `po`
  - Step into and through code with the console
  - Call Stack
  - Debug Gauges - CPU/Memory usage

## Objectives & Competencies

# Lesson
## Debugging with Xcode

When writing code, you will discover that as you write more code, the potential for bugs in your code increases. Bugs are a nuisance and many programmers spend most of their time trying to find and fix bugs. Discovering and fixing bugs is a difficult task; it takes time, practice and a knowledge of a few tools to get good at it.

Today we will practice our debugging skills by identifying the tools Xcode provides us.
We will use the five (5) recommended steps provided by Apple to fix bugs:

**Discover** - Identify the problem.

**Locate** - Determine where in the code the problem occurs.

**Inspect** - Examine the control flow and data structures of the running code to find the cause of the problem.

**Fix** - Apply your insight into the cause of the problem to devise a solution, and edit the code to suit.

**Confirm** - After editing, run the app and check it with the debugger to be sure the fix was successful.
