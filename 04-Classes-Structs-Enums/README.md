## Objectives & Competencies
1. Understand the differences between Classes & Structs in Swift
1. Create data models with both Classes & Structs
1. Identify and list reasons for encapsulating code in Structs, Classes & Functions
1. Use Enums to represent finite state
1. Identify and use pattern matching in enums
1. Model finite state with enums

## Class Materials

Slides: [Classes, Structs & Enums](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ob_DAPCZtCvwxohwgjXY1zDHmAfdfQlZvQYSnA9Fbyw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Baseline Challenges

1. Analogy
    - In groups, think in how you can explain how classes or structs work with an analogy. (5 min)
    - Share with the rest of the class. (5 min)

1. Defining a Struct
    - List all the elements that can be part of a specification for a house.
    - Model everything on the list with a struct for a house.
    - Examples:
      - a. Number of rooms
      - b. Number of kitchens
      - c. Number of bathrooms
      - d. It might have a garage or not

1. Defining a Class
    - List all the elements that can be part of a specification for a house owner.
    - Model everything on the list with a class for a house owner.
    - Examples:
      - a. Sleep in a room
      - b. Enter/Exit the house
      - c. If there is a garage, they can park
      - d. They own a house, use your previous struct

1. Defining an Enum
    - Individually, think in a concept that can be represented as an enum. Define an enum with your list of options for that concept. (5 min)
    - Share with the rest of the class. (5 min)

1. [Swift Playgrounds](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Swift-Language-Playgrounds/archive/swift4.zip)
    - Complete:
      - a. Chapter 12 on Initializers
      - b. Chapter 10 on Enums
