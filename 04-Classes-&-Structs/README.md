## Baseline Challenges

**Object Oriented House**

1. Go over this specification for a house.
A house has these properties:
  - a. Number of rooms
  - b. Number of kitchens
  - c. Number of bathrooms
  - d. It might have a garage or not

An owner of a house can perform these in his/her house:
  - a. Sleep in a room
  - b. Enter/Exit the house
  - c. If there is a garage, they can park

**Object Oriented Tesla Factory**

1. Imagine you are Elon Musk working on Tesla Model 3.
   We want to develop a system to build similar Cars from a specification in the assembly line.
  - a. List 5 components of a Tesla(Car) and 3 actions that a Tesla(Car) can perform.
  - b. Build a Tesla Car Factory in code with the specifications you came up with, that can create a Tesla Model 3 when needed.
