# Introduction to Swift

## Course Description

This class covers the foundations of Swift programming language. Students learn key concepts including variables, constants, keywords, conditionals, loops, data types, object oriented principles, and how to debug Swift in Xcode. Learning about these core concepts in mobile development will happen as students build games in Swift and complete exercises online.

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
