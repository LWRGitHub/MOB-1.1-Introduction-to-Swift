# Introduction to Swift

## Course Description

This class covers the foundations of Swift programming language. Students learn key concepts including variables, constants, keywords, conditionals, loops, data types, object oriented principles, and how to debug Swift in Xcode. Learning about these core concepts in mobile development will happen as students build games in Swift and complete exercises online.
